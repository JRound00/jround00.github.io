# Network Security Analysis Tool

The Network Security Analysis Tool is an open-source project designed to help cybersecurity professionals and network administrators assess the security of their networks. This tool automates the process of detecting vulnerabilities and provides actionable insights.

## Project Overview

**Objective**: To develop a comprehensive tool that simplifies the process of network security analysis.

**Technologies Used**:
- Python for backend development
- Vue.js for the frontend interface
- Docker for containerization

## Features

- **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**: Quickly identifies known vulnerabilities in the network.
- **Network Mapping**: Visualizes network topology and identifies connected devices.
- **Security Reporting**: Generates detailed reports on findings and recommendations for mitigation.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was ensuring the tool could scan large networks efficiently without impacting performance. We addressed this by optimizing the scanning algorithms and allowing for distributed scanning across multiple instances.

## Conclusion

The Network Security Analysis Tool represents a significant step forward in making network security assessment more accessible and efficient. By providing an open-source solution, we hope to contribute to the cybersecurity community and help organizations strengthen their defenses.
